You will find another Jory.jar file in the source code, it's just a source of the initial database.
Because in the first run for the runnable jar file, the program extracts from ITSELF the initial database and copies it to the user home
to be used from now then.
To simulate the JORY runnable jar file in Eclipse, you need to keep that file their.
for more illustration, please have a look at the extractDatabase() in the Resource Class.
