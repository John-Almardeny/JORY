# JORY

JORY is an intuitive, interactive & flexible preschool learning program for both native and non-native English children.

It provides visual & auditory learning materials for 7 different subjects.

One of the most important features of this program is that it allows the users (parent) to add new elements to every subject, delete elements and modify existing elements.
